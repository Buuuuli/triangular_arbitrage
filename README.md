<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This is Duke Fintech 533 final project(2022 Spring) for Team Triangle SWAT. We are building a triangle arbitrage trading app. Triangular arbitrage results from a discrepancy between three foreign currencies that occurs when the currency's exchange rates do not exactly match up. We are using python as the primary language. We successfully set up an interactive automatic trading system by using Dash to set up our website and linking to IBKR to obtain real-time data. All trade information will show in our app after every successful deal, such as the best trading path, capital invested, and profit gained.
